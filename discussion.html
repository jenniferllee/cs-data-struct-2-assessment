Recursion

1) In your own words, what is recursion?
    Recursion is when a function calls itself.

2) Why is it necessary to have a base case?
    It is necessary to have a base case because you need an end condition where the recursion is done.



Graphs

1) What is a graph?
    A graph is made up of nodes and arcs (which connect the nodes). The relationship between nodes
    could be directed or non-directed. Graphs can also be cyclic.

2) How is a graph different from a tree?
    A graph can be cyclic, and trees are acyclic.

3) Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
    Social network connections would be a good model with a non-directive graph.

Sorting

1) Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
    Bubble sort will compare the first two numbers in a list, and place the larger number to the right.
    It will then compare the second number with the third number, and do the same thing. This will
    continue until the largest number is at the end. This sequence will repeat until the list is sorted.

2) Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
    The list is split in half (or as close to half as possible). Those lists will continue to split in half
    until you have either 1 or 0 item per list. The lists will then merge so that the new lists are sorted
    as they are created. This is done by comparing index [0] of each list and appending the smaller item.

3) Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.
    A number in the list is chosen as a pivot. For each item in the list, the items smaller than the pivot
    are moved to the left, and the items larger than the pivot are moved to the right.
